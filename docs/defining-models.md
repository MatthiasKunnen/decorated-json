# Defining models

Decoverto is made aware of classes by the `@model` decorator. The class contains properties which are decorated by [`@property`](./defining-properties.md).

If your class has a constructor, it must have only optional parameters as Decoverto calls the constructor to create new instances of the class.

For inheritance, see [inheritance.md](./inheritance.md).
